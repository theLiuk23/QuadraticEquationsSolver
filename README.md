# QuadraticEquationsSolver
It solves quadratic equations by providing 2 solutions, by drawing a parabola in cartesian axes. There is also some customizable settings and print features.

If you want a setup file please visit my site (https://lucadallavilla.altervista.org/) and open the article called "Equazioni di secondo grado? Ez!", thank you!



The user needs to fill the boxes "a", "b" and "c" with some numbers (they can be both integer and decimal), the program will return the 2 possible soliutions (if any) and it will offer you the possibility to draw the relative parabola and to edit settings.
